# Taoiseach Clinic
  

**Welcome to [Taoiseach Clinic](https://8000-luinen-123-hyc0nio3mvx.ws-eu64.gitpod.io/)!**
  

This Readme provides an overview of what is the essence of the site. Taoiseach Clinic is a private hospital site where sick people can look for reliable treatment and excellent staff members in any case. It offers a wide variety of services and is available to anyone. Booking is simple and fast.

## Features

I explain the website features below.

- **Navigation bar**
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having any issues. The full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Pricelist and Contact us page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. 
  - The active page appears with orange, which highlights it from the background.

### **Features left to implement**
- I want to add a gallery with hardworking staff members and satisfied patients 
- and I will add a survey, where the users rate the Clinic
  


## Testing

I tested my codes continuously with the W3C validator and CSS Validator during my work. The biggest issue was the responsive design of the navigation system. So the navigation bar works perfectly, the book appointment link works as intended, section form is working, and the footer links open in a new tab.
